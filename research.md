To learn more, visit the accompanying website to my [doctoral thesis](/thesis/) to learn more about my research conducted at IRCAM. I have worked on

- [Glottal source detection and estimation](https://gitlab.com/bous/asdfg)
- [Neural vocoders](https://github.com/roebel/MBExWN_Vocoder)
- [Developed a framework for disentanglement of voice attributes](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/circe/)
- [Estimation of voice level](https://gitlab.com/bous/voicelevel) (vocal effort / intensity / musical dynamics in singing)

I'm currently a researcher at [Supertone](https://supertone.ai), where I maintain and develop our voice backbone, NANSY, used for [text-to-speech](https://play.supertone.ai/) and [voice conversion](https://www.supertone.ai/en/shift). My work includes

- [Self-supervised pitch estimation](https://ismir2025program.ismir.net/lbd_439.html) (in particular in the presence of sub-harmonics)
- Room acoustics estimation and modeling
- Estimation and transformation of other voice attributes
