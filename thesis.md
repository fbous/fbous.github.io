### Doctoral thesis of Frederik Bous
_UMR9912 STMS | IRCAM - CNRS - Sorbonne Université - Ministère de la Culture | Paris, France_

This website contains supplementary material to my doctoral thesis.

## Chapter 4 -- Glottal closure instant extraction

The chapter has been published at
[EUSIPCO 2020](https://doi.org/10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287687)
and the paper is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01220).
Implementation and weights are available from the
[git repository](https://gitlab.com/bous/asdfg).

## Chapter 5 -- Neural vocoder

Details about the MultiBand Excitet Wavenet vocoder can be found
in the original [publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/info13030103).
Sound examples can be found on the
[demo page](http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/roebel/MBExWN_demo/).
Implementation and weights of the vocoder are available from the
[git repository](https://github.com/roebel/MBExWN_Vocoder).

## Chapter 6 -- Bottleneck auto-encoder

Audio samples of the pitch transformation can be found on the
[demo page](http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/bous/thesis/ch6).
The original paper is open-access and can be found
at the [journal website](https://doi.org/10.3390/info13030102).

## Chapter 7 -- Transformation of perceived voice level

The chapter has been published at
[ICASSP 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10095740).
Audio samples of the voice level transformation can be found on the
[demo page](http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/bous/thesis/ch7).

## Chapter 8 -- Applications

The Farinelli voice was exhibited during the show
[an.other voice](https://casino-luxembourg.lu/fr/agenda/another-voice)
at Casino Luxembourg.
Recordings of the pieces using the neural voice transformation framework
are online:
