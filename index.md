  Welcome to my personal website!

  I'm Frederik Bous, a researcher in sound and AI,
  currently working on voice technology
  at the Korean AI start-up [Supertone](https://supertone.ai).
  Previously, I have worked at [IRCAM](https://ircam.fr),
  a French cultural institution for contemporary music,
  where I had the pleasure of collaborating
  with many world class artists
  on mixing AI technology with art.

  As a amateur artist myself,
  I'm always interested in exciting new challenges at the intersection
  between machine learning, signal processing and art,
  between scientific theory and applications in creative industries.

Thank you for taking interest in my work!

or if you want to use my voice transformations in your art project
I'm happy to connect and hear about your ideas!
