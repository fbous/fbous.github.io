  CIRCE is a voice transformation software
  capable of transforming pitch and intensity.
  The transformations are based on the neural auto-encoder
  developed in my thesis.

Originally developed to realize the voice transformations
for the [artistic residency of Judith Deschamps](/collaborations/anothervoice),
the software has since
been used in many other projects
by composers such as
[Omer Barash](/collaborations/GNZ),
[Sachie Kobayashi](/collaborations/day0)
and [AÃ¯da Shirazi](/collaborations/neentrecorps).

CIRCE is now available on the [IRCAM forum]({{ page.link }})
to any registered user (registration is free).

The research and software were developed as part of the ANR project [*ARS* (ANR-19-CE38-0001-03)](http://ars.ircam.fr/).
